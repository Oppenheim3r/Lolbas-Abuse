# Lolbas-Abuse

This is a simple practice of abusing Windows binaries to establish a connection. This can be achieved by executing the binary. If the phishing attempt is successful, you will establish a connection. Afterward, you would run a PowerShell script to disable Windows Defender and AMSI for runtime detection. Then, you can leverage whatever post-exploitation techniques you want. These scripts and code need to be more evasive with strong signatures. I did not provide the full version because I spent a lot of time on this work, so yes, it's not free :).
